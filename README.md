This repository demonstrates a subtle bug that can occur in COBOL programs due to implicit data type conversion during MOVE operations.  The bug is demonstrated in the `bug.cob` file.  A solution is provided in `bugSolution.cob`.  The bug involves the unexpected truncation or padding of data during a MOVE operation when the receiving field has a different PICTURE clause than the sending field. This issue can manifest subtly and is hard to detect without careful examination of the data flow. The solution emphasizes explicit data type handling and the use of appropriate conversion techniques to prevent the bug.
